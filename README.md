**Note**:
- You don't have to use a model that is tagged with tools, test different models if the one you are using isnt trigging the plugins.
- Tater currently recommends using gemma3:27b

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- **Redis-Stack**
- Ollama
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Setting Up Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasterPhooey/Tater-Discord-WebUI.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd Tater-Discord-WebUI
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

Using pip, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1
OLLAMA_PORT=11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma3:27b
CONTEXT_LENGTH=5000
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

5. **Run the Web UI**

Launch the web UI using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run webui.py
```

## Docker

### 1. Pull the Image

Pull the prebuilt image with the following command:

```bash
docker pull masterphooey/tater-webui
```

### 2. Configuring Environment Variables

Ensure you supply the required environment variables. You can pass these using the `-e` flag when starting the container. For example:

```bash
docker run -d --name tater_webui \
  -p 8501:8501 \
  -e OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
  -e OLLAMA_PORT=11434 \
  -e OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma3:27b \
  -e CONTEXT_LENGTH=10000 \
  -e REDIS_HOST=redis \
  -e REDIS_PORT=6379 \
  masterphooey/tater-webui
```

### 3. Access the Web UI

Once the container is running, open your browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

The Streamlit-based web UI will be available for interacting with Tater.



## Redis Persistence

If you're running Redis directly, you can ensure data persistence by configuring Redis's built-in persistence mechanisms. Redis supports two primary methods:

### 1. **RDB Snapshots:**  
   Redis periodically saves snapshots of your dataset to a file (typically named `dump.rdb`). You can control this behavior in your `redis.conf` file using `save` directives. For example:
   ```bash
   # Save a snapshot every 900 seconds if at least 1 key changed.
   save 900 1

   # Save a snapshot every 300 seconds if at least 10 keys changed.
   save 300 10

   # Save a snapshot every 60 seconds if at least 10000 keys changed.
   save 60 10000
   ```
### 2. Append Only File (AOF):
  Redis can log every write operation to an AOF file, which can be replayed to reconstruct the dataset.
  To enable AOF, add the following lines to your redis.conf:

```bash
appendonly yes
appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
```
### Alternatively, you can launch Redis with these persistence settings directly from the terminal (without modifying your redis.conf):
```bash
redis-server --save "900 1" --save "300 10" --save "60 10000" --appendonly yes --appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
```
