# Tater - A Discord Bot & Web UI Powered by Ollama

Tater is a Discord bot that integrates with Ollama to provide a variety of AI-powered tools, and now it also comes with a web UI for interactive chat. Whether you're on Discord or using the web interface, Tater uses advanced memory and context retrieval with embeddings to deliver improved, continuous conversations.

## Features

- **Conversation Continuity**: Maintains context using Redis and an embedding model for improved memory retrieval.
- **Ollama Integration**: Utilizes Ollama for AI responses, conversation memory, and embedding-based recall.
  - **Chat Responses**: Generates AI responses, waiting messages, and friendly error messages.
  - **Embedding Model**: Enhances chat history recall and provides more relevant responses by storing and retrieving past conversations.
  - **Requirements**:
    - Use an **Ollama model that supports tools** (e.g., `command-r:35b` is excellent). For more details, see [Ollama Tools](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools).
    - Use an **Ollama embedding model**. See available models here: [Ollama Embeddings](https://ollama.com/search?c=embedding).

## Available Tools

**Below are the tools available to you. Simply ask Tater to perform these tasksâ€”no slash commands or specific key terms are required:**

- **YouTube Video Summaries:**  
  Extracts YouTube video IDs, fetches summaries, and sends formatted responses.

- **Web Summaries:**  
  Summarizes webpages or articles.

- **Image Generation:**  
  Generates images based on text prompts using Automatic111/SD.Next.

- **Premiumize.me Integration:**  
  - Checks if a given URL is cached on Premiumize.me and retrieves download links.  
  - Processes torrent files to extract the torrent hash, checks cache status, and retrieves download links.

- **RSS Feed Monitoring:**  
  Automatically monitors RSS feeds for new articles and announces summaries to RESPONSE_CHANNEL when new articles are published. This integration includes three tools:  
  - **Watch Feed:** Add an RSS feed to be monitored.  
  - **Unwatch Feed:** Remove an RSS feed from monitoring.  
  - **List Feeds:** List all currently watched RSS feeds.

- **Web Search:**  
  Searches the web for additional or up-to-date information when needed. If the AI determines that it lacks sufficient knowledge or context to answer a query, it can trigger a web search to retrieve current information and use it to generate a final, accurate answer.
  
## Web UI Integration

The web UI provides a Streamlit-based interface to interact with Tater. Key features include:

- **Interactive Chat:**  
  Engage with Tater via an intuitive chat interface that supports chat history, file attachments, and tool function calls.

- **Discord Bot Settings:**  
  Configure Discord-related settings directly from the UI. In the sidebar, under the "Discord Settings" expander, you can set:
  - **DISCORD_TOKEN**: Your bot's token.
  - **ADMIN_USER_ID**: The Discord ID of the admin.
  - **RESPONSE_CHANNEL_ID**: The channel ID where Tater sends responses.
  - **RSS_CHANNEL_ID**: The channel ID for RSS feed announcements.

- **Chat Settings:**  
  Customize your user avatar and username. These settings allow you to personalize your experience and are stored persistently in Redis.

- **File Attachments:**  
  Upload files or images directly from the sidebar, which are then processed accordingly by Tater (for example, torrent files for Premiumize functions).

This unified interface lets you manage both chat interactions and Discord settings in one place, making it easy to deploy and maintain Tater across both platforms.

- **RSS Feed Management** (Discord-only):
  - **Watch Feeds**: Add an RSS feed to the watch list.
  - **Unwatch Feeds**: Remove an RSS feed.
  - **List Feeds**: List all currently watched RSS feeds.
  - (RSS feed announcements post to a dedicated Discord channel.)

## Embedding System (Memory & Context Retrieval)

Tater uses an embedding model to store and retrieve chat context, which improves chat continuity and memory recall. Instead of relying solely on the raw chat history, Tater:

- **Generates an embedding** (a vector representation) of each message.
- **Stores embeddings in Redis** for fast and efficient retrieval.
- **Retrieves relevant past messages** when a user revisits a topic, ensuring the AI's responses are informed by context.

### **Low RAM Mode (Optional)**
- By default, the bot **stores all embeddings indefinitely**, allowing it to recall long-term conversations.
- If running on a **low-RAM system**, you can enable memory limits by modifying `embed.py`:
  ```python
  # Uncomment the following line in embed.py to limit storage to the last 100 messages (saves RAM)
  # redis_client.ltrim(global_key, -1000, -1)
  ```
  - **Uncommenting this line** will ensure only the **last 1000 embeddings** are kept in memory.
  - This helps prevent excessive memory usage on systems with limited resources.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Setting Up Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasterPhooey/Tater-Discord-WebUI.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd Tater-Discord-WebUI
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

Using pip, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1
OLLAMA_PORT=11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=command-r:latest
OLLAMA_EMB_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
CONTEXT_LENGTH=10000
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
AUTOMATIC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7860
PREMIUMIZE_API_KEY=your_premiumize_api_key
```

5. **Run the Web UI**

Launch the web UI using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run webui.py
```

### Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image**

```bash
docker build -t tater .
```

2. **Run the Container**

```bash
docker run -d --name tater_bot -p 8501:8501 tater
```

## Redis Persistence

If you're running Redis directly, you can ensure data persistence by configuring Redis's built-in persistence mechanisms. Redis supports two primary methods:

### 1. **RDB Snapshots:**  
   Redis periodically saves snapshots of your dataset to a file (typically named `dump.rdb`). You can control this behavior in your `redis.conf` file using `save` directives. For example:
   ```bash
   # Save a snapshot every 900 seconds if at least 1 key changed.
   save 900 1

   # Save a snapshot every 300 seconds if at least 10 keys changed.
   save 300 10

   # Save a snapshot every 60 seconds if at least 10000 keys changed.
   save 60 10000
   ```
### 2. Append Only File (AOF):
  Redis can log every write operation to an AOF file, which can be replayed to reconstruct the dataset.
  To enable AOF, add the following lines to your redis.conf:

```bash
appendonly yes
appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
```
### Alternatively, you can launch Redis with these persistence settings directly from the terminal (without modifying your redis.conf):
```bash
redis-server --save "900 1" --save "300 10" --save "60 10000" --appendonly yes --appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
```
